                <h2>
                    Call of Duty: Black Ops I
                </h2>
                    <p>
                        The first game/series of games that comes to mind would have to be the Call of Duty franchise since it has been a staple game
                        that my brother and I loved to play growing up. Call of Duty: Black Ops I is the first Call of Duty game that I ever owned and played with my brother
                        and friends of ours. It is the first game that that made me become a competitive gamer and a competitive person in general. For those who may not know
                        the Call of Duty series is a multitude of first person shooter games that has multiple forms of playing such as multiplayer, zombies, and spec ops.

                </h3>
                    <p>
                        Destiny 2 is an incredible game that I played for hours with friends and even by myself since I was able to do raids with friends that would take 
                        hours to accomplish in order to obtain great loot from the bosses at the end of the raid. It took a lot of cooperation and patience to understand 
                        how to take on these raids and leading one another to ensure that everyone knew what to do during the raids.

                        Leagues of Legends, or League for short, is a 3rd person MOBA. MOBA stands for Multiplayer Online Battle Arena. 
                        In this game, you select a character from a cast of over 100+ champions which are all defined within the following
                        categories: Top lane, Mid lane, Jungler, ADC (Attack Damage Carry), or Support. Each champion falls under one or more of
                        these roles and if you do not like the character that you chose then there are 100's of others that could be your new favorite.

                        Dr. Mundo goes and does as he please.

                        In this series, the player is able to play as a vault hunter. Vault hunters are mercenaries on the search for vaults
                        accros the world that hold a plethora of things such as weapons, money, and power. The game in this series that I played
                        for hundreds of hours was Borderlands 2 since it had some an incredible story line and an insane replayability.

                <h3>
                    APEX LEGENDS
                </h3>
                    <p>
                        Apex Legends is a first person shooter, battle royal. In this game you drop into a map with one or two other people in order
                        to fight other players until only one team survives. Before you can even drop into a match you are given the option to select
                        the character that you would like to play as in the match. The main difference between the characters would be their role in the
                        team which could be put into the following roles: support, mobility, or damage. The competitive aspect of this game makes it a rush
                        to play with friends especially when they are as competitive as my brother and I.

                    <p class="Apex_Legend">
                        One of my favorite characters in Apex would have to be Octane. He is a high mobility legend that moves incredibly fast and slowly regenerates
                        his health. The posibilities with his kit/powers is only limited by how daring of a play you want to make.

                    GAME OF THE YEAR = ELDEN RING
                </h2>
                    <p>
                        THE MOST INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE OF A GAME THAT I HAVE EVER PLAYED. Elden ring is a third person action role-playing game in which you play,
                        as a tarnished which are individuals who are driven to become an elden lord. This is one of the hardest but rewarding games that I have ever played.
                        Both exploration and tenacity are both rewarded and punished if you are ill prepared and doubt your own skills. This is a game that I would highly
                        recommend anyone and everyone to play because the story alone is incredible and definitely worth the effort to complete (I still have to finish it myself haha).
